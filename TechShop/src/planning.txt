Minimal Features for a Small React E-commerce Site:
- Product Catalog: Displays a list of all available products, optionally grouped by categories. Users can browse, filter, and search for products.
- Product Details Page: Shows detailed information about a selected product, including images, description, price, and an option to add the item to the cart.
- Shopping Cart: Allows users to view items they have added, update quantities, remove products, and see the total price before checkout.
- Simple Checkout: Provides a summary of the order, collects minimal user information (like name and address), and confirms the order. No payment processing is included.
